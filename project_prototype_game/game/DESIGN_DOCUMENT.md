## Game Mechanics

### Movement System

#### Pacman Movement
- Grid-based movement with directional input
- Smooth direction changing at intersections
- Wall collision detection

#### Ghost Movement
- Directional movement with AI decision making
- Mode-based behavior patterns
- Collision avoidance
- Speed variation based on mode

### Ghost AI System

#### Behavior Modes

1. **Chase Mode**
   - Aggressive pursuit of Pacman
   - Each ghost has unique targeting strategy
   - Blinky: Direct pursuit
   - Pinky: Ambush strategy (4 tiles ahead)
   - Inky: Complex targeting based on Pacman and Blinky
   - Clyde: Fallback to scatter when close

2. **Scatter Mode**
   - Retreat to corner areas
   - Periodic switching with chase mode
   - Safe zones for player regrouping

3. **Frightened Mode**
   - Random movement patterns
   - Vulnerable to Pacman
   - Time-limited duration
   - Visual indicator (blue color)

4. **Eaten Mode**
   - Return to ghost house
   - Invulnerable during return
   - Fastest movement speed

#### Mode Switching
- Timed transitions between modes
- Power pill activation triggers frightened mode
- Progressive difficulty increases mode switching frequency

### Collision Detection

#### Pacman-Ghost Interaction
- Position-based collision detection
- Mode-dependent outcomes
- Score modification based on interaction type

#### Wall Collision
- Boundary checking
- Maze structure navigation
- Movement validation

### Scoring System

#### Points Awarded
- **Dot Collection**: 10 points per dot
- **Power Pill**: 50 points per pill
- **Ghost Eating**: 200 points × (ghosts eaten in sequence)
- **Fruit Collection**: 100 points per fruit
- **Level Completion**: 1000 points + (level × 500)
- **Extra Life**: Awarded at specific score thresholds

#### Multipliers
- Sequential ghost eating bonus
- Level progression bonus
- Difficulty-based scoring adjustments

### Power-Up System

#### Power Pill Mechanics
- Temporary invincibility
- Ghost vulnerability
- Time-limited duration
- Visual feedback for remaining time

#### Frightened Mode
- Ghost behavior modification
- Score bonus opportunities
- Strategic gameplay element

### Level Design

#### Maze Layouts
- Multiple unique level designs
- Progressive difficulty
- Strategic power pill placement
- Balanced dot distribution

#### Difficulty Progression
- Increased ghost speed
- Modified mode switching timing
- Reduced power pill duration
- Enhanced AI behavior

## Advanced Features

### Ghost Personalities

Each ghost has distinct behavior patterns:

1. **Blinky (Red) - Shadow**
   - Aggressive chaser
   - Direct pursuit of Pacman
   - Most dangerous ghost

2. **Pinky (Pink) - Speedy**
   - Ambush predator
   - Targets 4 tiles ahead of Pacman
   - Predictive movement patterns

3. **Inky (Cyan) - Bashful**
   - Unpredictable behavior
   - Complex targeting algorithm
   - Least aggressive normally

4. **Clyde (Orange) - Pokey**
   - Follower behavior
   - Switches to scatter when close
   - Least threatening ghost

### Fruit System

#### Spawn Mechanics

#### Fruit Types
- Cherry (100 points)
